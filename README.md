The classic "bulls and cows" game implementation in Lua. You have 20 tries to guess
a randomly generated number of 4 different digits while the computer opponent is
trying to reveal your number. Currently it is a very stupid computer opponent who
just tries random numbers.

Created just for my first experience with Lua.
